What is a function:

know the dif between function call, definition, and prototype

functions uses: to break up a large complex program into a bunch of smaller mini programs. 
-what is passby copy? what does that mean? 

function prototypes are necessary because when you get to a line in you rprogram, it only knows what comes before it. 


function definition (basically just the actual function). Your definition has to be typed at the beginning and its return must match the type. 

library functions vs user/prgrammer defined functions 

## library functions
pow(x,y) -> <math.h>
- you can look up functions to see what they do but in this class we will msotly write out own
#incluce<stdio.h>
  - printf, scanf, fprintf, fscanf, fopen, fclose
#include<ctype.h>

## programmer defined functions 

parameter vs argument

parameter - the list inside the commas. 
argument- function calls take arguments 

return types we will use: 
- int
- double
- char
- void (cannot leave this out on a function definition)

## Algorithm 
Algorithms have nothing to do with the language.

4 basic components: 
- a circle
- parallel lines
- a base line
- intersecting lines

(youre just pseudo coding tbh)

you can make a flow chart or a numerical algorithm

## Functions with Arguments

- input arguments: arguments used to pass info to a func sub program.
- output args: args used to return results to the callling function.

*passby copy and passby value mean the same thing

declaring a variable inside of the args ()
\n - new line 
\t - tab 


preCondition: what must be true to use the function
postCondition: what is true after the function is called


input/return ^^^ 

The best way to test code is to use the main as a driver. So test to make sure that function works before you use it in another function. Call it in the main.

## C operations:
<= less than
>= greater than
== equal 
< > 

## program 4
- 2 parts
- ### part 1
  - write the algorithm
  - aka pseudocode the program
  - look at the output and write your pseudo code based on this
  - tami recommends using numbers to list the steps

### part 2
- you have to have 7 items on your menu
- doesnt matter what food
- make up the prices, make them normal
- items must be numbered
- if they have an order over $20 they have to add money until they have enough

 programs 4, 5 and 6 build on each other.
